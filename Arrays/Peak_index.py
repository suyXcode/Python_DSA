# 852. Peak Index in a Mountain Array

# You are given an integer mountain array arr of length n where the values increase to a peak element and then decrease.

# Return the index of the peak element.

# Your task is to solve it in O(log(n)) time complexity.

 

# Example 1:
# Input: arr = [0,1,0]
# Output: 1
# Example 2:
# Input: arr = [0,2,1,0]
# Output: 1
# Example 3:
# Input: arr = [0,10,5,2]
# Output: 1

# Constraints:

# 3 <= arr.length <= 105
# 0 <= arr[i] <= 106
# arr is guaranteed to be a mountain array.
